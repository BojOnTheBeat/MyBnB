Should we use numbered options or basic commands and put the commands in a user manual?
When they sign in, save their name as a public var so we can display it on every menu from then on or something 
Include a manual(working on that). 
Technically the entire app is on one page...kinda like using regular command_line programs



Main Menu:

=====Welcome To MyBnB======

What do you want to do?

1. Sign in as Host
	
	"What is your SIN?"

		"Welcome Mrs. X" //Find name based on SIN typed

		"Type "display_manual" to see everything you can do"//



2. Sign in as renter
	
	"What is your SIN?" //Find name based on SIN typed

		"Welcome Mr. x"

		"Type "display_manual" to see everything you can do"




3. Create a Host Profile
	
	"Type these details in this order..." 

		"Welcome Mr X, thank you for choosing MyBnB" //Goess back to main menu for user to now sign in if they want to do something

4. Create a Renter Profile
	
	"Type these details in this order..."

		"Welcome Mr X, thank you for choosing MyBnB" //Goes back to main menu for user to sign in if they want to do something.


0. Exit//Include 'exit' on every page
